Certainly! Below is an overview of common operations involving iterators in Python, along with a set of practice exercises:

### Operations on Iterators:

1. **Iterating Over Elements**:
   - Iterators are objects that represent a stream of data and can be iterated over using a `for` loop or by calling the `next()` function.
   ```python
   my_iter = iter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   for element in my_iter:
       print(element)
   ```

2. **Using `next()` Function**:
   - The `next()` function is used to access the next element of an iterator.
   ```python
   my_iter = iter([1, 2, 3])
   print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 1
   print(next(my_iter))  # Output: 2
   ```

3. **Creating Iterators**:
   - Iterators can be created from iterable objects like lists, tuples, strings, etc., using the `iter()` function.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   my_iter = iter(my_list)
   ```

4. **Custom Iterators**:
   - Custom iterators are created by defining a class with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.
   ```python
   class MyIterator:
       def __iter__(self):
           self.current = 1
           return self

       def __next__(self):
           if self.current <= 5:
               result = self.current
               self.current += 1
               return result
           else:
               raise StopIteration
   ```

5. **Iterable Objects**:
   - Iterable objects are objects that implement the `__iter__()` method, allowing them to be iterated over.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   my_iter = iter(my_list)
   ```

### Practice Set for Iterators:

1. **Iterating Over Elements**:
   - Create an iterator for a list of your favorite fruits and print each fruit using a `for` loop.

2. **Using `next()` Function**:
   - Create an iterator for a list of your favorite colors and print the first two colors using the `next()` function.

3. **Creating Iterators**:
   - Create an iterator for a string containing your name and print each character using a `for` loop.

4. **Custom Iterators**:
   - Define a custom iterator called `Countdown` that iterates from 10 to 1.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over the `Countdown` iterator and print each number.

5. **Iterable Objects**:
   - Create an iterator for a dictionary containing your favorite movies and print each movie using a `for` loop.

6. **Practical Use Case**:
   - Define a custom iterator called `FileReader` that reads lines from a text file and yields them one at a time.
   - Use the `FileReader` iterator to read and print the lines of a sample text file.

These exercises cover a variety of operations and concepts related to iterators in Python and should provide good practice for beginners.
