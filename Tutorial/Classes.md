Certainly! Below is an overview of common operations involving classes in Python, along with a set of practice exercises:

### Operations on Classes:

1. **Defining Classes**:
   - Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon, with the class body containing attributes and methods.
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age
   ```

2. **Creating Objects (Instances)**:
   - Objects, also known as instances of a class, are created by calling the class name followed by parentheses containing any required arguments.
   ```python
   person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
   ```

3. **Accessing Attributes**:
   - Attributes of an object can be accessed using dot notation.
   ```python
   print(person1.name)
   print(person1.age)
   ```

4. **Defining Methods**:
   - Methods are functions defined within a class and can operate on the attributes of the class.
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def greet(self):
           return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."
   ```

5. **Calling Methods**:
   - Methods of an object are called using dot notation.
   ```python
   message = person1.greet()
   ```

6. **Inheritance**:
   - Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, known as parent or base classes.
   ```python
   class Student(Person):
       def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
           super().__init__(name, age)
           self.grade = grade
   ```

### Practice Set for Classes:

1. **Defining and Creating Objects**:
   - Define a class called `Car` with attributes `make` and `model`.
   - Create an object of class `Car` with make "Toyota" and model "Camry".

2. **Accessing Attributes**:
   - Access and print the make and model attributes of the car object created in the previous step.

3. **Defining and Calling Methods**:
   - Add a method `drive` to the `Car` class that returns a message "Driving {make} {model}".
   - Call the `drive` method on the car object and print the message.

4. **Inheritance**:
   - Define a class `ElectricCar` that inherits from the `Car` class and has an additional attribute `range`.
   - Create an object of class `ElectricCar` with make "Tesla", model "Model S", and range 300 miles.

5. **Accessing Inherited Attributes**:
   - Access and print the make, model, and range attributes of the electric car object created in the previous step.

6. **Overriding Methods**:
   - Override the `drive` method in the `ElectricCar` class to return a message "Driving {make} {model} quietly".
   - Call the `drive` method on the electric car object and print the message.

These exercises cover a variety of operations and concepts related to classes in Python and should provide good practice for beginners.
