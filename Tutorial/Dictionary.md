Sure! Here's an overview of common operations on dictionaries in Python along with a set of practice exercises:

### Operations on Dictionaries:

1. **Creating Dictionaries**:
   - Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` constructor.
   ```python
   my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
   another_dict = dict(name='Jane', age=25, city='London')
   ```

2. **Accessing Elements**:
   - Elements in a dictionary are accessed using keys.
   ```python
   name = my_dict['name']
   age = my_dict.get('age')
   ```

3. **Adding and Updating Elements**:
   - Use square brackets to add a new key-value pair.
   - Use square brackets to update the value of an existing key.
   ```python
   my_dict['job'] = 'Engineer'
   my_dict['age'] = 35
   ```

4. **Removing Elements**:
   - Use `del` statement to remove a key-value pair by key.
   - Use `pop()` method to remove and return the value of a specific key.
   ```python
   del my_dict['city']
   job = my_dict.pop('job')
   ```

5. **Checking Key Existence**:
   - Use `in` keyword to check if a key exists in the dictionary.
   ```python
   if 'name' in my_dict:
       print('Name is present')
   ```

6. **Iterating Over Dictionaries**:
   - Use `keys()` method to iterate over keys.
   - Use `values()` method to iterate over values.
   - Use `items()` method to iterate over key-value pairs.
   ```python
   for key in my_dict.keys():
       print(key)
   for value in my_dict.values():
       print(value)
   for key, value in my_dict.items():
       print(key, value)
   ```

7. **Copying Dictionaries**:
   - Dictionaries can be copied using the `copy()` method.
   ```python
   copied_dict = my_dict.copy()
   ```

### Practice Set for Dictionaries:

1. **Create Dictionaries**:
   - Create a dictionary containing details about yourself: name, age, city.
   - Create another dictionary containing details about your friend: name, age, city.

2. **Accessing Elements**:
   - Access the age of yourself and your friend from the dictionaries.

3. **Adding and Updating Elements**:
   - Add a new key-value pair to each dictionary containing your profession.
   - Update the age of yourself and your friend in the dictionaries.

4. **Removing Elements**:
   - Remove the city key-value pair from each dictionary.

5. **Checking Key Existence**:
   - Check if the profession key exists in each dictionary.

6. **Iterating Over Dictionaries**:
   - Print all keys in each dictionary.
   - Print all values in each dictionary.
   - Print all key-value pairs in each dictionary.

7. **Copying Dictionaries**:
   - Create a copy of each dictionary using the `copy()` method.

These exercises cover a variety of operations and concepts related to dictionaries in Python and should provide good practice for beginners.
