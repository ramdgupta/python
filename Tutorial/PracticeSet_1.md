# Practice Sets for Python Knowledge Levels

## Beginner Python Knowledge:

1. Variables and Data Types:

   - Create variables to store your name, age, and favorite color. Print them to the console.
   - Declare variables of different data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans). Perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numeric variables.
   - Create a list of your favorite foods and print each item.

2. User Input:

   - Ask the user for their name and age using `input()`. Combine them into a greeting message like "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."
   - Prompt the user for a number, convert it to an integer using `int()`, and double its value. Print the result.

3. Control Flow:

   - Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using an `if` statement.
   - Create a program to check for eligibility to vote (age >= 18).
   - Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

## Intermediate Python Knowledge:

1. Functions:

   - Define a function to add two numbers and another function to calculate the area of a rectangle (length * width). Call these functions with different arguments.
   - Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of words in it.
   - Write a function to determine if a given number is prime.

2. Lists and Tuples:

   - Use list comprehensions to generate a list of even numbers between 1 and 20.
   - Create a list of tuples, where each tuple holds a student's name and grade. Iterate through the list and print each student's information.
   - Sort a list of names in alphabetical order using the built-in `sorted()` function.

3. Dictionaries and Sets:

   - Create a dictionary to store information about a book (title, author, year published). Access specific values using their keys.
   - Use a set to store unique elements from a list of numbers.
   - Create a dictionary whose keys are country names and values are their corresponding capital cities. Iterate through the dictionary and print each key-value pair.

4. Modules and Packages:

   - Import the `math` module and use functions like `sqrt()` and `pi` to perform mathematical calculations.
   - Use the `random` module to generate random numbers and experiment with different functions like `randint()` and `random()`.
   - Explore other modules like `os` and `datetime` to interact with the operating system and work with dates and times.

## Bonus Challenge:

Combine these concepts to create a simple game or a basic data analysis program using data from a CSV file.

Remember, these are just a few examples. Practice consistently and explore different problems to solidify your understanding and develop your Python skills!
